## General

*  [Tuples](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences) are immutable. 
[Sequence Types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq) that can contain any data type.
*  Tuples are [iterable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable).
*  Elements within tuples can be accessed via [bracket notation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30250282/whats-the-difference-between-the-square-bracket-and-dot-notations-in-python), using a zero-based index.  
* Other [Common Sequence Operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations) can also be used when working with tuples.

###  1. Retrieve and return the map coordinates from and item on Azaras list.

* Remember:  tuples allow access via _index_, using _brackets_.  Indexes start at zero.

  

### 2. Format coordinates from Azaras list to match coordinates from Ruis list.

*  The `tuple` constructor will take _any iterable_ as an argument, unpack it, and return a tuple.
*  Strings are iterable in python.

   

### 3. Check to see if a record from Azaras list "matches" a record from Ruis list.

*  [in keyword](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#membership-test-operations) for testing membership.
*  The `tuple()` constructor will make a tuple from _any iterable_.  


  

### 4. Combine a record from Azaras list with a record from Ruis IF they are at the same coordinates.

* [common sequence operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations)  
* Could you use the `compare_records()` function here?
  

### 5.  "Clean up" & print out the records from Azara and Rui so that there's only one set of coordinates per record, and they have a list of everything they need to put on the map.


*  Remember:  tuples are _immutable_, but the contents can be accessed via _index_ using _bracket notation_.
*  Tuples don't have to use parentheses unless there is _ambiguity_.

   
### 6.  There's been a last minute addition to the team!  Since there are now three team members sharing the combined info, there needs to be three "complete" record groups to refer to.
